--On Access controlled pages (resource: http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-login-form.html) 

For those pages that can only be accessed by registered members, we need to put a check on the top of the page.
Notice that we are setting an "authorized" session variable in the login code above. On top of pages we want to protect, we check for that session variable. If user is authorized, we show him the protected content, otherwise we direct him to the login form.

--On including files: http://php.net/manual/en/function.require-once.php

If your code is running on multiple servers with different environments (locations from where your scripts run) the following idea may be useful to you: 

a. Do not give absolute path to include files on your server. 
b. Dynamically calculate the full path (absolute path) 

ex. <?php 
define('__ROOT__', dirname(dirname(__FILE__))); 
require_once(__ROOT__.'/config.php); 
?> 

--note: headers must be parsed before any html code
